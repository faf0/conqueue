# About

This is a double-ended queue (linked list) implementation providing
thread-safe and re-entrant interface functions.
It supports the following operations

* push front
* push back
* pop front
* pop back
* queue traversal

This is my solution of an assignment in the course
[CS511](https://web.stevens.edu/compsci/graduate/masters/courses/viewer.php?course=CS511&type=syl) (Concurrent Programming) at Stevens Institute of
Technology in the Fall of 2012.
